These requirements include, but are not limited to the following specialized security screenings:\nMicrosoft Cloud Background Check: - This position will be required to pass the Microsoft background and Microsoft Cloud background check upon hire/transfer and every two years thereafter.\nPreffered Qualifications:\n• Master's Degree in Computer Science or related technical field AND 8+ years technical engineering experience with coding in languages including, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, or Python OR Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or related technical field AND 12+ years technical engineering experience with coding in languages including, but not limited to, C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, or Python OR equivalent experience.\n• Experienced in program leadership, communication, and stakeholder management skills with the ability to influence leaders and make data-informed decisions.\n• Proven track record shipping cloud services or platforms at scale (multi-tenant, high-throughput) with measurable customer and business impact.\n• Security domain expertise (e.g., threat detection/response, SIEM/SOAR, identity, endpoint, cloud security) and familiarity with analyst workflows.\n• Experience with GenAI/LLM techniques and tooling (prompt engineering, retrieval/vector stores, agents/tool use, content safety/guardrails, offline/online eval frameworks, vibe coding).\n• Hands-on coding ability in one or more languages (e.g., Python, C#, C++, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript); comfortable prototyping, reading Pull Requests (PRs), and engaging deeply in technical design reviews.\n• Demonstrated success driving zero-to-one (0→1) initiatives from ambiguity to Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to General Availability (GA) and then to one-to-many (1→N) platform adoption across multiple product teams. What makes a great Principal AI Engineer here\n• Model-literate and pragmatic: you know when to use a Large Language Model (LLM), when a deterministic/rules-based or classical Machine Learning (ML) approach is better, and how to hybridize them with retrieval, caching, routing, and fallbacks to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and cost targets.\n• Evaluation-obsessed: you can define the right metrics and datasets (clarity, groundedness, precision/recall, latency/cost etc.), build the eval harness, and insist on measurable improvements before broad rollout.\n• Zero-to-one (0→1) builder and one-to-many (1→N) integrator: you turn ambiguous ideas into Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), then lead General Availability (GA) platformization and integration into large, multi-tenant Microsoft Security products. You define durable data/Application Programming Interface (API) contracts and Software Development Kits (SDKs), negotiate dependency graphs across partner teams to meet delivery dates and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) within complex cost, security/privacy/compliance constraints to ensure operational readiness.\n• Customer-back and outcome-focused: you spend time with defenders and admins, translate workflows into crisp specs, land adoption, and iterate quickly based on feedback and telemetry.\n• Clear communicator and connector: you create clarity in ambiguity, align diverse stakeholders across research/engineering/design/field, and mentor others to raise the bar.\nSoftware Engineering IC5 - The typical base pay range for this role across the U.S. is USD $139,900 - $274,800 per year.
